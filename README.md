# SQL Replication

"Sqlr" is a tool to maintain database schema.

The benefits of using "Sqlr":
- Uses the simplest form of the input without requiring SQL language
- Generates code without accessing the database server
- Doesn't require maintaining any kind of history

How the magic happens:
- Each table and column definition needs a GUID that shouldn't be changed through out the whole life of the project.

# Input

The following items are needed:
- database name
- tables definition json array file
- users definition json array file
- report flag to add informative logs to SQL output
- dry-run flag to list required changes without applying them

## Tables

The tables are defined by an array of the table objects.

Example:
```
[
]
```

### Table

A table is an object that has the following fields:

# Output

The output is a SQL code that will apply required changes in a server.

# Remarks

- The GUID of the tables and columns shouldn't be changed through out the lifetime of the project. Changing them will cause data loss.
- The account of the new users are locked to prevent unwanted access. After applying the output, admins need to alter new users to set password and unlock the accoutn. e.g. ALTER USER 'Alice' IDENTIFIED BY "${password_for_alice}" ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
